### Aim

The main objective of our system is to use Machine Learning to predict hotel booking cancellation chances 

### Working

The dataset has 32 features out of which 2 unimportant features are removed to reduce unnecessary overhead of system. This system performed well with many machine learning alorithms like decision tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, K- nearest neighbours, Naïve Bayes, adaboost and xgboost.
